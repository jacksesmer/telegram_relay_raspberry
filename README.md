# telegram_relay_raspberry
Using telegram to control relays

The material used in this project was one raspberry (raspian) py 2 and a shield with 8 relays.

Project made in python 3.7

*pip install telepot*

It's can be used for many users in the same time so for more control was created two accounts types one of than "Admin" and the other one "User"

It's possible rename the relays too.
Was created a help with the commands.
